# Problem Solving Curriculum

When you are done going through this curriculum you should be able to employ a methodical approach to solving problems, whether it's with a product owner, project manager, teammate or at a whiteboard interview.

## Introduction

When thinking about solving problems, it can be helpful to use [Polya's Problem Solving Techniques](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) as a guide.

1. Understand the problem
1. Devise a plan
1. Carry out the plan
1. Look back

Those seem like very high-level descriptions, and if you read [Berkeley's overview](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) you'll find some more details about how that works.  In the following lessons you'll learn _specific_ techniques for solving software problems, and specifically applying these steps to whiteboards as well.  Here's an overview:

## Applying Polya's Techniques to Software

1. Understand the Problem
   1. [Step 1: Identify Inputs and Outputs](./Steps/Inputs and Outputs.md)
   1. [Step 2: Ask "What if" Questions](./Steps/What If Questions.md)
1. [Devise a Plan](./Steps/Tradeoffs and Choices.md)
   1. Come up with more than one plan
   1. Evaluate your potential solutions and choose the most appropriate
1. [Carry Out the Plan](./Steps/Sandwich Code.md)
   1. Quickly dispense with boilerplate code
   1. Write code 'outside in'
1. [Look Back](./Steps/Test Your Solution.md)
   1. Test every branch of your solution
   1. Try to break your solution / do QA
