# Inputs and Outputs

The first question / assumption you should verify when thinking about an algorithm problem is to figure out what the inputs and outputs are.

Pay careful attention to the _type_ of the input and output (string, number, boolean etc...) - this will help determine what boilerplate code to write.

Also pay attention to which inputs are _required_ and which are _optional_, and for optional ones, what their default values might be.
